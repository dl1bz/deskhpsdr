/*
 * This file contains data (tables) which describe the layout
 * e.g. of the VFO bar. The layout contains (x,y) coordinates of
 * the individual elements as well as font sizes.
 *
 * There can be more than one "layout", characterized by its size
 * request. So the program can choose the largest layout that
 * fits into the allocated area.
 *
 * What this should do is, that if the user increases the width of
 * the screen and the VFO bar, the program can automatically
 * switch to a larger font.
