Here the instructions for compile the deskHPSDR app under macOS.
You need to have basic knowledge, how you work with the Terminal app and the shell running in Terminal app.

1. Prerequisites

For compiling under macOS we need the following prerequisites:

1.1 X Window manager for macOS

Please go to www.xquartz.org and download the latest package file (e.g. XQuartz-2.8.5.pkg) and install the package.

1.2 Xcode command line tools

Start the Terminal app and install the needed Xcode command line tools:
~$ xcode-select --install

2. Get the source code from github.com:
~$ cd $HOME
~$ mkdir src
~$ cd src
~/src$ git clone https://github.com/dl1bz/deskhpsdr.git
~/src$ cd deskhpsdr
~/src/deskhpsdr$

3. Prepare the macOS environment for compiling with the included script:
~/src/deskhpsdr$ ./MacOS/prep_macos.sh

If you need one of the Soapy-Modules, please edit the ./MacOS/prep_macos.sh at the bottom and remove the comment marker "#"
from the Soapy module you want to use. Per default only the base Soapy-API will be installed. If you want to use Soapy-based SDR devices
you need edit the make.config.deskhpsdr too and set SOAPYSDR=ON. I don't need the Soapy-support, because I use a Hermes-Lite 2.

PLEASE DON'T EDIT the Makefile ! Do all changes only in the make.config.deskhpsdr ! This file will be read from the Makefile and
include your own settings into the Makefile without changing the Makefile itself.

4. Compile the deskHPSDR
After Pt.3 we can now compile deskHPSDR:
~/src/deskhpsdr$ make install

Now you can find on your macOS Desktop the deskHPSDR app symbol, which you can start.
Thats all, we're ready.

5. Update deskHPSDR
From time to time you need to update deskHPSDR. That means, we update the source code from github.com and recompile deskHPSDR.

5.1 update the source code, start the Terminal app:
~$ cd $HOME
~$ cd src
~/src$ cd deskhpsdr
~/src/deskhpsdr$ make update

5.2 cleanup the last compiling process:
~/src/deskhpsdr$ make clean

5.3 re-compile deskHPSDR:
~/src/deskhpsdr$ make install

Troubleshooting:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there some wrong, simply start new from Zero:
-> start the Terminal app
~$ cd $HOME
~$ cd src
~/src$ rm -fr deskhpsdr
~/src$ git clone https://github.com/dl1bz/deskhpsdr.git
~/src$ cd deskhpsdr
~/src/deskhpsdr$ git checkout master

Edit the make.config.deskhpsdr for your needed options and continue again from Pt.4.

Notice: Pt.3 need to execute only one time, but you can repeat it if you want and not sure, if all is ok.

The Xcode command line tool will be updated with the regular macOS Software Updates.
The Homebrew environment need updated by yourself:
-> start the Terminal app
~$ brew update
~$ brew upgrade

Basically it's ever a good idea, after updates of Xcode command line tools or Homebrew environment to re-compile deskHPSDR.

You can use "make clean", which removes the deskHPSDR.app from your Desktop, but don't delete the working directory, that means,
all config-files (*.props) stay untouched. deskHPSDR use an own working directory, so you can find all in the directory
$HOME/Library/Application Support/deskHPSDR if using macOS - if you want you can switch between deskHPSDR and piHPSDR on your macOS
at the same machine.

Please don't change three options in the make.config.deskhpsdr at the moment:
ATU=OFF
COPYMODE=OFF
DEVEL=OFF
Leave this three options as they are (OFF) and don't change this please.

Thats all, folks :)
